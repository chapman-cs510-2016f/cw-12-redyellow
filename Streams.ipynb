    "1.A C-string, which consists of an array of characters terminated by the null character '\\0', and which therefore is different from an ordinary array of characters. There is a whole library of functions for dealing with strings represented in this form. Its header file is <cstring>. In some implementations this library may be automatically included when you include other libraries such as the <iostream> library. Note that the null character may very well not be the very last character in the C-string array, but it will be the first character beyond the last character of the actual string data in in that array. For example if you have a C-string storing \"Hello\" in a character array of size 10, then the letters of the word \"Hello\" will be in positions with indices 0 to 4, there will be a null character at index 5, and the locations with indices 6 to 9 will contain who-knows-what. In any case, it's the null character at index 5 that makes this otherwise ordinary character array a C-string.\n",

    "2.A C++ string object, which is an instance of a \"class\" data type whose actual internal representation you need not know or care about, as long as you know what you can and can't do with variables (and constants) having this data type. There is a library of C++ string functions as well, available by including the <string> header file.\n",
